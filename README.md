# Node-Webpack-React Demo

This project was created for a Claremont Colleges Hackathon workshop. It is meant to be a step-by-step process of how to create a simple web application using Node, NPM, Webpack, React and the Spotify Web API.

## Running the App

To run the app, clone this repo and run

``````
npm install && npm start
``````

## Going through the demo

The [keynote presentation](node-demo.key) provides a walkthrough of configuring and creating the app. The slides in the presentation also correlate to commits on this repo so that you can check out the state of the code at any point in the presentation. The corresponding commit id will be displayed in the top right of each slide with the command

``````
git reset --hard {commit-id}
``````
